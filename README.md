# vue-skill-profile

This is an example VueJS project I built to showcase my skills as a
frontend developer. All data has been generated by a script and there is
no backend providing the data. Source code is located here:

https://github.com/smack0007/vue-skill-profile

## Technologies Used

- [Vue.js (v3)](https://vuejs.org/)
- [Bootstrap + Icons (v5)](https://getbootstrap.com/)
- [InversifyJS](https://inversify.io/)
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)

## Highlights

- On every commit the application is automatically
  redeployed via GitHub pages.

- I wrote a very basic script to generate the data
  used by the application.

- All data is deployed with the application but I've
  attempted to emulate loading from a backend via the
  services.
- Services are injected into the components using
  dependency injection provided by InversifyJS.
